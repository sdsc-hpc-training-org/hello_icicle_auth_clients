1. add a way for the requires expression decorator to also accept direct expression input

2. add way for the client to popup a new window every time it runs

3. ruyn the client startup more naturally, more like you would other commands

4. Make the client run on a state system to allow more graceful interface with the server. THis would mean you could have a state for accessing systems, for accessing files, submitting queries etc

5. what if there is a command that requires secure input and a form? how can commands handle several decorators

6. Standardize the library, to make it redistributable for other project

7.  make schemas more intuitive, so that the schema type isnt explicitly states, maybe make ti copy the class name?
