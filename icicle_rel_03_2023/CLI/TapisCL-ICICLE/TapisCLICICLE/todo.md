1. Consider adding an abstract command class interface thing, or metaclass from which the different commands under the tapis systems can inherit. THis would allow the help generator to iterate over the attributes of the class, instead of explicitly specifying a dict of commands, this could be autogenerated. 
This way the "partial" thing with the decorators could be phased out. This would also make it so the methods dont have to have a connection parameter. Command state can be changed depending on whether the code is running headless or as a client. metaclass checks for doc on the command

2. command groups are more just for organization of classes now and for help menu. every time command group instantiated it contributes its commands to the overall command list. Good for simplifying command syntax

3. Decorators must be upgraded to support the new design of the commands

4. add a way for the requires expression decorator to also accept direct expression input
