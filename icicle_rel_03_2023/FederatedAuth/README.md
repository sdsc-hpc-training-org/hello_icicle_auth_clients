# Federated Tenant Auth API
This is a simple API to access a json file mapping Tapis tenants to their respective authenticator clients. The user can call "get_client_code" in order to retrieve the client ID, which can then be used in code to authenticate to a Tapis tenant using Tapis federated authentication.
